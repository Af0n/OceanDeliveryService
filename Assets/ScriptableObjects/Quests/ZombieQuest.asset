  description: "Grando, the semi-retired zombie warlord, needs you to round up some
    feed for his \u201Cbattle hens.\u201D Apparently they eat only the best, and
    the 'best' seems to be trying to talk to you from inside the package. It's probably
    best not to think about it too much. Head to the big ass island, he hangs around
    the volcanoe."
